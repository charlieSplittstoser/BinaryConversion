# BinaryConversion
Converts numbers from base 10 to other bases using string concatenation.

This program accepts input of a positive decimal number up to 32 bits in size and then converts it to binary.
Once it is in binary form, the program then converts it to the following:
- Octal
- Hexadecimal
- Decimal

This program can also perform unsigned binary addition of binary numbers up to size 32 bit.

Future additions/goals:
